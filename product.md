Setting up the document and code base was a little harder for some of our group as they
they code in macbook pros. Also, implementing our music background player was 
really challenging as youtube does not let us embded a youtube video. Also, playing 
music mp3 files due to api limitations.We decided to go big first, when we should have
started simple components than gradually added harder components to the project
to have a more diverse demo. Working in group's is defenetly harder since time 
management is different for everyone, thus working toguether was a little difficult 
without creating a time management timeline. 

Working on the project, everyone was able to contribute evenly. David was team leader,
so dispersing responsibilities was easier. Working over zoom was definetely harder, as
we couldn't help each other as much as we wanted. In the future, meeting at least once
a week as a group would help a lot. Also, setting soft and hard deadlines for certain
deliverables would help a lot in streamlining the project.
